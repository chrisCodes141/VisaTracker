Goal:

Create a microservice architecture for a full stack project using angular and springboot where the goal is to track users visa status and payment.

Technology Stack

    Angular (Front-End):
        User dashboards, visa status updates, payment processing interface.
        Angular Material or Tailwind CSS for UI components.
    Spring Boot (Back-End):
        REST APIs for business logic.
        Spring Security for authentication/authorization.
        Kafka for inter-service communication.
    Database:
        PostgreSQL for structured data storage.
        S3 for document uploads (e.g., visa copies, receipts).
    Event Streaming:
        Kafka topics for:
            visa-status-updated
            payment-processed
            notification-triggered
    Containerization:
        Docker for each service.
        Docker Compose for local development.
    Cloud Services:
        AWS EC2 for hosting.
        RDS for databases.
        S3 for file storage.

Architecture Overview

    Front-end: Angular for a responsive and interactive user interface.
    Back-end: Spring Boot microservices with REST APIs for Visa Tracking, Payments, User Management, and Notifications.
    Database: Separate databases for each microservice to ensure data isolation and scalability.
    Communication: Services communicate asynchronously using Kafka for event-driven interactions.
    Deployment: Docker for containerization and orchestration with Docker Compose or Kubernetes for scaling.
    Cloud Integration: AWS for hosting, RDS for databases, S3 for file storage, and CloudWatch for monitoring.
    Visualization: Tableau for dashboard analytics (e.g., visa status trends, payment history).

Microservices
1. User Management Service

    Responsibilities:
        User registration, authentication, and authorization (JWT-based).
        Storing user profiles (e.g., name, email, nationality).
        Role-based access (e.g., admin, user).
    Endpoints:
        POST /users/register
        POST /users/login
        GET /users/{id}
    Database:
        User table: id, name, email, password_hash, role.
        User metadata: last_login, created_at.

2. Visa Tracking Service

    Responsibilities:
        Storing and updating visa status information.
        Tracking visa expiry dates and renewal deadlines.
    Endpoints:
        POST /visa
        GET /visa/{userId}
        PUT /visa/{id}
    Database:
        Visa table: id, user_id, visa_type, status, expiry_date, notes.

3. Payment Service

    Responsibilities:
        Managing payment records for visa applications.
        Integrating with external payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal).
        Storing payment history.
    Endpoints:
        POST /payments
        GET /payments/{userId}
        GET /payments/status/{paymentId}
    Database:
        Payment table: id, user_id, amount, currency, status, transaction_date.

4. Notification Service

    Responsibilities:
        Sending email or SMS notifications for visa expiry and payment reminders.
        Event-driven notifications triggered by Kafka messages.
    Endpoints:
        POST /notifications
    Database:
        Notification log table: id, user_id, type, message, status, timestamp.
		
High-Level Workflow

    User Interaction:
        Users register and log in via Angular.
        The front end communicates with the User Management Service for authentication.
    Visa Management:
        Users can add or update their visa information via the Visa Tracking Service.
        The service emits a Kafka event for visa-status-updated.
    Payments:
        Users make payments for visa applications via the Payment Service.
        The service emits a Kafka event for payment-processed.
    Notifications:
        The Notification Service listens to Kafka events and sends reminders for upcoming visa expiries or payment confirmations.
    Dashboards:
        Users view their visa status, payment history, and notifications via an Angular dashboard.
        Admins can use Tableau for visualizing data trends.
